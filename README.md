## ðŸš€ About Me
Began my professional journey at a trading firm, where I learned basic Python skills to create trading algorithms to enter/exit positions based on given parameters. After a while, I realized that data scraping and cleaning was not my forte, and wanted a new challenge where I could regularly challenge myself while using creative problem solving. 

I took a leap and enrolled into BrainStation's Web Development bootcamp. After 12 long weeks, many late nights and cups of coffee later, I came out the other side with skills in Javascript, React and a newfound love for web development. 

I have recently begun a role at GroupBy Inc as a junior front-end developer for the pre-sales team, where we recieve vision boards and create beautiful and functional websites to pitch to potential clients. This is just the beginning for me, and I'm more than excited to see where my coding journey is going to lead me.
