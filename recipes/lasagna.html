            This recipe is a family favorite, often served for special occasions
            that is created with a tasty tomato sauce with tiny meatballs and
            creamy mozzarella, which are layered between delicate sheets of
            homemade egg noodles. You can of course use store bought noodles but
            the end result will just not be as tender as if you made them
            yourself. I often vary this recipe by adding a couple of layers of
            bechamel sauce between layers of the tomato meatball layers which
            creates a nice creamy texture. Buon Appetito!

              Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and once hot add the pork bones
              over medium heat and cook until well browned. Add the onion and
              continue cooking until it is tender. Add the garlic and stir well,
              cooking an additional minute. Finally add the puree, paste and 1
              cup of water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next add the oregano, 1/2 cup of the parsley, the basil, red
              pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Bring everything to a boil and
              then reduce heat to a simmer.
            </li>

              Taking the ground beef (or beef/veal mix), and add the egg, bread
              crumbs, 1/4 parsley, 1/3 cup Parmesan Cheese and salt and pepper.
              Add the milk to the bread cubes and soak. Once the bread is soft
              use your fingers to break it up and then add it to the meat
              mixture. Mix all the ingredients together well with your hands,
              and then roll into small 1 inch sized meatballs and drop carefully
              in the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continue cooking the sauce for about 2 hours over low heat, adding
              additional water as needed if the sauce becomes too thick.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the meatballs and the pork bones from the sauce with a
              slotted spoon and place into a small bowl when the sauce is
              complete.
            </li>
            <li>
              To assemble the lasagne, add about 1/2 cup of sauce to the bottom
              of a large lasagne pan, then add a little water and mix.Make an
              overlapping layer of the noodles across the bottom of the pan.
              Spread a large spoonful of sauce on top, making sure the noodles
              are well covered. Add one more layer of noodles and sauce, and
              then add a layer of the mozzarella slices. Continue in this manner
              until you have 5 layers.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the top, cover the noodles well with the sauce, place another
              layer of mozzarella, then sprinkle on the parmesan. To finish,
              evenly place the meatballs across the top surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover with foil, and bake in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for
              about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook another 10 minutes. Let
              rest an additional 10 minutes before serving.
