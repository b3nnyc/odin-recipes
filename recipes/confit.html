            Duck confit takes a while to prepare properly but is well worth the
            effort. This melt-in-your mouth duck treat will become a favorite. I
            buy whole ducks and then remove legs/wings whole and breasts from
            the bone. Always keep the skin on duck! You can easily double this
            recipe if you're having a dinner party. I learned this method from
            Chef Uriah of the Columbian Cafe of Astoria, Oregon. The breasts
            become pan roasted Muscovy duck (see my recipe) and the legs/wings
            become confit. Never roast a Muscovy duck whole: the breast comes
            out dry, musky, and bitter tasting.

          <ol class="container__recipe-instructions">
            <li>
              Combine shallot, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic, and thyme in a small
              bowl. Rub all over duck legs, thighs, and wings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrange duck parts skin side-up in a dish and cover with plastic
              wrap. Refrigerate until the seasoning is well absorbed, 24 to 48
              hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rinse off the seasoning and pat the duck dry. Arrange duck in a
              single layer in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Let duck stand until it
              reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
              Melt duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbles begin
              to form, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour duck fat over the room-temperature
              duck.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake duck in the preheated oven until tender and the juices run
              clear, 2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
              bone should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Pour off the duck
              fat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brush a grill pan with some of the used duck fat and heat over
              medium-high heat until smoking. Add baked duck; cook in batches
              until skin is crispy, about 90 seconds per side.
