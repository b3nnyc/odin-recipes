            Shepherd's Pie comes to us from England, and is traditionally made
            with lamb or mutton. Here in the states we are more of a beef eating
            culture than a lamb eating one, and when one is served "shepherd's
            pie" here, it is most often made with ground beef. In England (and
            Australia and New Zealand) they would call the beef dish a "cottage
            pie" and the lamb dish "shepherd's pie". Regardless of what you call
            it, a shepherd's pie is basically a casserole with a layer of cooked
            meat and vegetables, topped with mashed potatoes, and baked in the
            oven until the mashed potatoes are well browned. When you dig in you
            get a spoonful of mashed potatoes, some crispy bits, meat, and
            vegetables all in one bite. It's pure comfort food.

          <ul class="container__ingredients-list">
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 large (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) potatoes , peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>
              1 to 2 cups mixed vegetables, such as diced carrots, corn, or peas
            </li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground round beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Pepper and/or other seasonings of choice</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="container__recipe-title">Recipe</h3>
          <ol class="container__recipe-instructions">
            <li>
              Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover
              with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring
              to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20
              minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>
              While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter
              in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and
              cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes. If you are including
              vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots
              should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to
              cook as the onions do. If you are including peas or corn, add them
              toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat
              starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook
              until no longer pink. Drain the pan of excess fat, if necessary
              (anything more than 1 tablespoon). Season with salt and pepper.
              Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a
              simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes,
              adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying
              out. Taste the cooked filling and, if needed, add more salt,
              pepper, Worcestershire, or other seasonings of your choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce),
              remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the
              remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with a fork or potato
              masher, taste, and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spread the cooked filling in an even layer in a large baking dish
              (such as a 9 x 13-inch casserole. Spread the mashed potatoes over
              the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed
              potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well
              browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the
              mashed potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about
              30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help
              the surface of the mashed potatoes brown. (Be careful when
              broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to
              shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if
              you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)
